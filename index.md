# Introduction

Welcome to this beginner-friendly Python tutorial. The goal is to build your confidence with Python's fundamentals through concise explanations, hands-on examples, and small exercises. Below are four core sections that will guide your learning from writing simple scripts to working with data and building small projects.

## 1. Getting Started: Installation & Basics

This section covers setting up Python on your machine, choosing an editor or IDE, and running your first Python programs. You'll learn about the Python REPL, how to create and run `.py` files, and basic interpreter concepts like statements, expressions, and comments.

## 2. Core Python: Data Types & Control Flow

Explore Python's built-in data types (numbers, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries) and learn to manipulate them. This section introduces variables, type conversion, comparison and logical operators, and control flow structures such as `if`/`elif`/`else`, `for` loops, and `while` loops. Small exercises focus on practical patterns like iterating collections and basic data transformation.

## 3. Functions, Modules & Error Handling

Learn how to organize code into reusable functions, pass arguments, return values, and use default and keyword arguments. We'll also cover importing standard library modules, creating your own modules, and handling errors and exceptions with `try`/`except`/`finally`. This section emphasizes writing clean, reusable code and simple testing approaches.

## 4. Working with Data: Files, Libraries & Mini Projects

Apply your skills to real tasks: reading and writing files, parsing CSV or JSON, and using popular libraries (like `requests`, `pandas` for data tasks, or `matplotlib` for visualization) as optional extras. The section ends with small project ideas (a CSV analyzer, a simple web-scraper, or a data plotter) to consolidate learning and build a portfolio of tiny projects.

Happy learning â€” try the examples, break things, and build small programs. If you'd like, I can also add code snippets and exercises for each section inside this file.
